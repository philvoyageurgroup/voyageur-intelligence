Use numbered sections with sub-sections (e.g., 3.1, 3.2) exactly like a consulting report. Do NOT start with a top-level title — the cover page handles that. Start directly with section 1.

## 1) Executive Summary
3-5 bullet points: what's happening in this category RIGHT NOW. Be specific — name brands, cite share shifts in basis points, identify structural forces. End with "why this matters for [brand]."

## 2) Category Size & Dynamics
- TTM revenue, YoY growth %, prior 12-month revenue if available
- Top ASINs by revenue (cite 3-5 with monthly revenue, units, brand)
- 2-3 structural growth signals (new launches, format shifts, premiumization)

## 3) Brand Landscape & Competitive Tiers

### 3.1 Brand tiers (by market share)
- Tier 1 — Structural Leaders (>=5% share): name, share %, share delta, strategy
- Tier 2 — Growth Cluster (2-5% share): name, share %, what they're doing
- Tier 3 — Long Tail / Niches (<1.5%): describe the clusters and formats

### 3.2 Brand motion & strategy
- Biggest Winners (by share change): name each, basis points gained, WHY
- Brands losing share: name each, basis points lost, what's happening

### 3.3 Ad Spend vs Market Share (if data available)
- Over-spenders vs share (buying visibility)
- Under-spenders with strong equity (efficiency upside)
- Implication paragraph

## 4) ASIN Landscape & Product Architecture

### 4.1 Hero ASINs (top-line anchors)
Table or list: ASIN, brand, monthly revenue, price, rating, page score if available

### 4.2 Key Product "Families" & Architectures
Number each product family (1. 2. 3. etc.) with brands, price band, description

### 4.3 Lifecycle mapping
- Mature evergreen winners (old launches, huge review moats)
- Scaling recent launches (high growth, strong scores)
- At-risk or peaking SKUs (negative growth, saturation signals)

## 5) Search & Demand Landscape

### 5.1 Core search pillars
Number each pillar with the terms and which brands map to them

### 5.2 Generic vs branded search dynamics

### 5.3 White space
Under-served search angles where current assortment doesn't meet demand

## 6) Price & Pack Architecture

### 6.1 Main price bands
Break into value / core mid / upper mid / premium with brands and formats in each

### 6.2 Opportunity
Where there's room for premium positioning, bundles, or clear claims

## 7) Reviews, Content & Conversion

### 7.1 Ratings & review volume
Who has the review moats, who's vulnerable

### 7.2 Content quality observations
What separates the winners (page scores, imagery, A+ content)

## 8) Strategic Opportunities & Playbooks
Break into 2-3 archetypes relevant to this category (e.g., "If you're a large incumbent", "If you're a scaling Amazon-native", "If you're entering fresh"). Number specific actions under each.

## 9) Actionable To-Do List
8-10 numbered concrete next steps. Prioritized. Each one specific enough to hand to someone and say "do this."
