Use numbered sections with sub-sections (e.g., 2.1, 2.2) exactly like a consulting report. Do NOT start with a top-level title — the cover page handles that. Start directly with section 1.

## 1) Brand Overview
- Revenue scale (TTM $), subcategory rank, 12-month trajectory
- Category context: total category TTM, brand's share %, where they sit vs top 5

## 2) Share Trend & Competitive Position

### 2.1 Share math
- TTM share vs prior 12-month share: exact basis points gained or lost
- Context: is the category growing faster than the brand? (if category +X% and brand +Y%, what does that mean for share?)

### 2.2 Competitive positioning
- Which specific competitors are gaining ground and why
- Which competitors are losing ground and why
- Where does this brand sit in the "big and growing" vs "big but losing share" matrix?

## 3) ASIN Portfolio Deep Dive

### 3.1 Hero SKUs
Top 3-5 ASINs: ASIN, title, monthly revenue, units, price, rating, review count, lifecycle stage (launch date if visible)

### 3.2 Portfolio health
- Review moat strength: which SKUs have deep review counts (500+) vs thin (<100)?
- Price architecture: how are their SKUs distributed across price bands?
- Lifecycle: which are mature cash cows, which are scaling launches, which are declining?

### 3.3 Content & conversion quality
- Page scores if available, imagery quality signals, A+ presence
- How does their content compare to top competitors?

## 4) Search Term Ownership

### 4.1 Terms they likely win
Top search terms where this brand's products appear strongly

### 4.2 Gaps
Search terms where competitors capture demand that this brand should own

### 4.3 White space opportunities
Under-served search angles this brand could claim

## 5) Competitive Threats
2-3 specific brands encroaching on their space:
- For each: name, TTM $, growth rate, share delta, what they're doing differently, why it's a threat

## 6) Recommended Focus Areas
3-5 concrete moves, prioritized by impact. Each one:
- What to do (specific)
- Why it matters (tied to data above)
- Expected impact (directional)
